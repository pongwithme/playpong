Ah, the joys of Azure. We had over 150 commits to our project but migrating the repo from the Azure cloud to Github wiped 'em all.

Anyway, this is the code base for our MHack IV team's app PongWithMe, a game that allows you to play a game of pong by physically moving your phone around as a paddle. Sounds pretty cool, right? For more info check out our website [here](http://pongwithme.github.io/pongwithme-lp/)
